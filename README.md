# A Simple **Things** Manager

This project is a simple CLI app that used to write things down. This project is inspired by ([Twos App](https://www.twosapp.com/)), and created with the only purpose of learning and experimenting. 

This project used `SQLite3` as its main dependencies to store information as databases. Not only that, I also added a ([Bcrypt by hilch](https://github.com/hilch/Bcrypt.cpp)) to try out one way of storing password.

## My intention of this project
This project is my way of learning databases and a little bit of object oriented programming. By making this project, at least I can have some kind of direction of using all the tools that I learn on college.
